# RDL
Thesis - Remote Data Logging

## Abstract
This report covers the design and implementation of a remote data logging system. This
system allows for two-way communication between a base station and a remote station.
Data logged through the system is saved to an online database and visualised through
a custom web application. Loadshedding (power interruption) compatibility is implemented in this system,
allowing for data to be logged during periods of internet unavailability. This report contains
the system-, electronic-, network- and software design required to create this solution.
The final system is fully operational and can be used within farming or weather tracking
operations. The remote data logging solution proposed with this report was built with
modularity in mind and can be extended to various fields of operation.
